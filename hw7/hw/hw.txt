1. Yes, the network will still be secure. The data is encrypted using the receiver's
public key, which will be visible to the attacker, but can only be decrypted by the receiver's
private key, which is located only on the receiver's computer. 

(1) The network will be secure. The private key is still only located on the receiver's computer, 
and knowing the passcode for the private key through tracking keystrokes is useless unless the attacker 
actually has access to the private key. The private key is randomly generated and cannot be reconstructed
by knowing keystrokes. 

(2) The network will possibly no longer be secure. If the private key is stored on the USB, then 
the attacker will be able to access it and decode the encrypted communications. If the key is not 
stored on the USB, then the network will still be safe. 

2. The detached signature is created using the private key of the signer, and it is verified by
the receiver using the public key. However, we don't actually know if the private/public keys
were created by the original owner of the files. If an attacker intercepted the data and replaced the signature 
and public key with his own, then the signature would still match the private key, and gpg --verify would not 
detect any issues. One way to solve this problem is for the owner of the files to provide his public key to a 
trustworthy third party, so it can be confirmed that the public key received by the receiver indeed belongs to 
the owner of the files.
