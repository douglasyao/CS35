Checking out version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch called "quote:

$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

Installing patch:

$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Use the emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) to add a ChangeLog entry to the patch.

We open emacs and type C-x 4 a to create a new ChangeLog entry, then adapt the change log from the original patch. 

The ChangeLog looks like this:

2017-03-14  Douglas Wang Yao  <classdya@lnxsrv04.seas.ucla.edu>
    
    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
    
    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.
    
    NOTE: only source code is changed. ` symbols in comments are unchanged.

    * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
    * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
    (compare_files):
    * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
    (read_diff):
    * src/dir.c (compare_names):
    * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
    * src/util.c (finish_output):

    Quote 'like this' in output.
    
Now, commit changes:
$ git commit -aF ChangeLog

Creating a new branch of 3.0 called 'partner':
$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner

Applying the patch:
$ git am partner-formatted-patch.txt
Applying: 2017-03-17 An Thai Nguyen <ant@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu>

Building the resulting system:
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make 

Checking that patch works:
$ src/diff . -
src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
$ src/diff --help

No ` symbols are obesrved.

Verify that ChangeLog entry works using 'make distdir':
$ make distdir 

A new directory called diffutils-3.0.1-d67f is created. When we enter it and examine the ChangeLog file,
we can see that it includes our ChangeLog at the top:
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-d67f
$ head ChangeLog

To run gitk on the GNU Emacs git repository, we need to first allow X-11 forwarding through ssh. 
$ ssh -X classdya@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

Then, we navigate to the folder containing the repository:
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk
