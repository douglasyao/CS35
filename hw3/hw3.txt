1. Because the goto statement in line 2036 to case_long_iso_time_style was
removed, this line can be taken out, since it names the statement to be jumped
to in the goto statement. However, it's not technically necessary to take this
line out, since all it does is give the following line a name. The code will
run fine even with it present. 

2. The code is now set up so that the format defaults to POSIX rather than ISO
if the locale does not have a specified style. This could be problematic if the
user is not from an English-speaking country, because the default POSIX format
lists the month in English.

3. An error occurs: IndexError: list index out of range. This error occurs
because the choice function from the random module requires the input sequence
to not be empty.

4. A syntax error occurs. Exceptions in Python 3 are not iterable, whereas they
are in Python 2.
