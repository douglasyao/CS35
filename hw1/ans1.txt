1. From the manual page of man:
-K     Search for the specified string in *all* man pages.

2. Using the which command:
[classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ which cp
/bin/cp
[classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ which wc
/usr/bin/wc

3. [classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ find /usr/bin -executable -type f -name ?
/usr/bin/w
/usr/bin/[
[classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ whatis w
w                    (1)  - Show who is logged on and what they are doing

4. Use 'ls -l /usr/bin' to list all files. We see the following:
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root          23 Aug 28  2015 emacs -> /etc/alternatives/emacs
This means that /usr/bin/emacs is actually a soft link to /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5. g+s sets the group of the file as the group that owns the file. 
This means that the file is executed as the group that owns it, 
rather than the group executing the file.
o-w removes the write ability of "others", 
or users not the owner of the file or members of the group

6. Include the argument '-mtime -21' to the find command

7. Include the arguments '-type d -mtime -21' to the find command

8. [classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ which find
/bin/find
Using 'ls -l /bin' yields the following symbolic links:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 Dec 22  2015 awk -> gawk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 Aug 29 13:01 csh -> tcsh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        8 Jun 18  2012 dnsdomainname -> hostname
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        8 Jun 18  2012 domainname -> hostname
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 Oct  5 15:17 egrep -> grep
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        2 Jan  6 13:56 ex -> vi
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 Oct  5 15:17 fgrep -> grep
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        3 Aug  8 14:47 gtar -> tar
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       41 Aug 28  2015 iptables-xml -> /etc/alternatives/bin-iptables-xml.x86_64
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       20 Aug 28  2015 iptables-xml-1.4.7 -> /sbin/iptables-multi
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       21 May 16  2016 ksh -> /etc/alternatives/ksh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       22 Jan  2  2015 mail -> /etc/alternatives/mail
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        8 Jun 18  2012 nisdomainname -> hostname
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 Jun 18  2012 rnano -> nano
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        2 Jan  6 13:56 rvi -> vi
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        2 Jan  6 13:56 rview -> vi
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        4 May 16  2016 sh -> bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       10 Jun 18  2012 traceroute6 -> traceroute
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        2 Jan  6 13:56 view -> vi
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        8 Jun 18  2012 ypdomainname -> hostname
This comes out to 20 total symbolic links. 

9. Using 'ls -lt /usr/lib' and scrolling to the bottom: 
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root    28776 Mar  3  2010 libgamin-1.so.0.1.10

10. [classdya@lnxsrv01 ~]$ which locale
/usr/bin/locale

   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET

C-M-b: move backward over a balanced expression
C-M-c: recursive edit
C-M-d: move down in parenthesis structure
C-M-e: move to the end of the current or following defun

13. C-g cancels a partially typed command or one which is still running.

14. Yank reinserts text that was previously killed.

15. The emacs dired commands displays hidden files, whereas ls -l does not.
